# learn how to cache credential using cookies, using tokens; through that we can see login information
# Stedi Laptop -> sends request (also OTP) to Stedi API (sends token back to Laptop) -> goes to Twilio API -> sends SMS to Phone -> One Time Password (OTP) -> Stedi Laptop
# Postman is used for debugging APIs
# we created a new folder in postman, to send phone number
# we got a code sent to our phone number, a one time password, and through that code we used that to send the OTP to the API to recieve a token
# we talked about the interface of a login to our accounts, and we drew out the phone number option, the request code, the password, the create account, and the login and everything else 
# all you have to remember is the phone number, to press request code, and to submit the one time code to get logged in
# We changed the login page, to make it this ^^^^^

# three things i learned from the video
# 1. The companies want to hire people who can work with people, not just people that can communicate with IT, but with business people
# 2. at Ncloud, they would rather prefer someone who is certified in AWS over someone that has a 4 year degree
# 3. The first 10 minutes of an AWS meeting are reading reports, and so therefore you must be very good at writing, and good at communication through writing.
